## Project Requirements

- Design a detailed building using Gazebo's Building Editor that consists of several rooms with enough space for robots to move (MountainHouse)
- Design a model for a certain robot using Gazebo's Model Editor with different links connected through joints (RoverBot)
- Design a world using Gazebo that contains previously designed building + two instances of the model + a model from Gazebo's online Library
- Create a simple welcome message plugin using C++ that launches when the world launches in Gazebo

The requirements of this project were met as approved by Udacity's reviewers.
